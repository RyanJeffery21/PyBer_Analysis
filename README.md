# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to provide visualizations for ride sharing data in different markets.  These visualizations were to be used in a presentation to the CEO to help understand what types of communities may be underserved.

# Results

As we can see, all three city types had similar dips and spikes in fares collected throughout this study period.  The urban community remained the highest grossing city type throughout the year, followed by suburban, and then rural.

Using the above figure, we can see the much more distinct differences between the three commmunities.  It can be assumed that the reason for the higher average rides in the rural and suburban communities would be a result of longer travel times to the destination. Most interesting in this graph is that the urban communities actually have more drivers available than rides given.  

## Conclusion and Recommendations

1. The urban market is clearly the main source of revenue for the company and should continue to be a focus.  Looking at a longer set of data to see if the relationship between having so many drivers available and higher total fares continues to correlate.
2. Increase the number of drivers available to the suburban market in an attempt to capture more of that business.  It is naturally the next market to expand into and try to grow.
3. The rural market stands out as being underserved just because of its much smaller number of drivers, but further study would be required to see if there is business being missed.
